# Semi-Useful-CSS-graphics

This repository is just a place to dump some of my CSS creations that I plan to integrate into a webpage or site that I'm working on, or may work on in the future. As I create graphics for different webpages I make, this repository will no doubt grow.

Anyone is welcome to take source code from this repository and use it as described by the license file. Have some fun with it, I don't know.

I'm sorry if the names of files are weird I forget words sometimes and name my files strange things based on what I think seems logical at the time, which isn't always logical upon later examination.
